# Multithreading-and-Parallel-Processing-in-Java

A parallel recursive tree traversal program by using both explicit multithreading and ForkJoinPool.
The main program would ask the user to:
-> input the set of nodes that the user would like to check.
-> specify the technique the user would like to use for the above query processing, i.e., explicit multithreading or ForkJoinPool.
-> total number of threads that should be used in parallel processing.
